# ProgrammaticUICustomCollectionView

This project is a sample project of creating a UICollectionView with a custom Pinterest style layout
with multiple section headers. Also, everything is done programatically--no storyboards or Xibs. I had originally planned to write a tutorial for this, but don't really have the time at the moment, so figured I'd just post the code anyways. 

Below is an example of what this project produces:
